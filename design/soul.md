# SOUL

Each soul is a part of a sprit of the world
It has a trait light ( 0 to 1.0) which determines
which way it wants to world to balance. 0 for darkness and 1 to light
and everything in between

Every souls primary goal is to get the world around them to reach thier
level of light/darkness.

Each soul has a secondary goal to reach out to other souls. Make friendship
with souls which are similar , persuade ones which are dissimilar. Or eliminate
souls which do not get persuaded. Eliminating a soul has a price that it has a
negative outcome on your light / darkness
